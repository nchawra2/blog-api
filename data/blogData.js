Did you have any idea that just changing your diet could really improve your sleep?Now, what to eat?  Be suspect of food intolerances if you have sleep challenges.  Some of the common food sensitivities include wheat, dairy products, corn and chocolate.  It is thought that with the intolerance, the brain releases histamines.  These histamines upset your biochemistry causing restlessness, irritation and inattentiveness during the day and insomnia at night.  The histamine replaces the neurotransmitters and causes a disruption in the brain’s biochemical circuitry, which is responsible for thinking, mood and behavior.  When this circuitry is disrupted, on of the symptoms can be insomnia. ",

The film took two years of her time and during that period she had to let go of several films in Telugu. But after Mohenjo Daro’s debacle Hegde changed her career plan completely by accepting films down south and refusing a lot of Hindi films. Her ‘strategy’ definitely paid off since Hegde has given quite a few hits and blockbusters in South in the last four to five years. Not just that, Hegde is a rare Telugu heroine who has worked with south superstars like Allu Arjun, Mahesh Babu, Jr NTR, and Prabhas in a short span of time. “I have been getting good and bigger films down South, so I said ‘No’ to a lot of Hindi films.

      "Singer-anchor Aditya Narayan sounds exceptionally excited about fatherhood. “We have been blessed with a baby girl on 24 February. Shweta had to undergo a ‘C’ section. I was with her in the hospital for almost a week. Now we are back home.”Aditya and his wife have named their daughter Twisha. Says Aditya, “I was the only one in the family rooting for a girl right from the start. Twisha is a Sanskrit word. It means ‘Rays Of Light’. My father’s name Udit, my name Aditya and now my daughter Twisha are all light-related. Twisha is almost an anagram of my wife’s name Shweta. A lot of thought has gone into the naam-karan.”",

I don’t know how many Indian films prior to this have been screened in this section. But I’m am glad a mainstream Indian film will make its way to this posh platform.”",

If necessary, add another splash of almond milk to blend. Note: If you do not have a blender, you can whisk the ingredients together by hand until a smooth batter forms.Heat a frying pan or nonstick griddle over medium heat. When the pan is hot, spray with olive oil spray or brush lightly with butter. Pour about ¼ cup of batter onto the griddle to form each pancake. Cook until small bubbles start to form on the surface, about 1 minute. Flip and cook on the other side for approximately 1 minute. Note: Cooking times will vary based on the thickness of your batter. These pancakes tend to run thinner than regular pancakes, so watch carefully to ensure they do not burn. ",

It’s been shown that paying particular attention to your nutrition immediately post-competition positively influences your subsequent performance in both training and competition.The choices of post-exercise nutrition options are endless. You could simply drink water or an electrolyte drink, down a protein shake, have a glass of milk, eat a meal, or enjoy any combination of these. But how about the benefits of that childhood favorite, chocolate milk?Well, for starters, milk is incredibly nutritious. It contains over ten nutrients that are important for our nervous system, muscle function, energy levels, and of course, our bone health. More specifically, milk is a rich source of vitamins A, B1, and B12, as well as calcium, potassium, magnesium, zinc, protein, and phosphorous.",

      "Mistake 1: Going too heavy, too fast. You do have to challenge yourself if you want to build muscle, but within reason. Going too heavy or too fast can lead to serious injuries and keep you out of the gym for a while. Start with lighter weights while you master your form, and progress to heavier weights once you know your form is solid.  Mistake 2: Skipping your rest days. There’s often an attitude of “more is better” when it comes to fitness—but this isn’t the case with strength training. When you lift weights and challenge yourself with resistance against your body, you cause small tears in your muscle fibers. When you rest, your muscles repair and grow back stronger. Skipping your rest days can interfere with this process and put a damper on your muscle growth. Mistake 3: Lifting too light a weight (not implementing progressive overload). In order to get stronger, you have to challenge yourself: Your body will adapt to the resistance placed on it, and will get stronger over time. This process is called progressive overload. If your weight is too light, it won’t create enough stimulus to induce adaptation. Use a weight where you can do 10 to 12 reps with good form, and find it challenging at the end.",

Lie down on your back and place a hand on your stomach. (Hsu says this can actually make the breathing exercise easier.)Step two. Inhale through your nose, breathing directly into your belly. Think of it like a balloon; you want to inflate your belly with air and feel it rise against your hand. (The chest should remain still.)Step three. Exhale through your nose or mouth. Your stomach should fall as you exhale. Again, if you’re thinking of your belly like a balloon, the balloon should deflate on the exhale.Step four.
